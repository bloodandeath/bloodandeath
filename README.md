## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome wanderer to a very minimalistic experience. Here I will attempt to solve the world's problems using the simplest solutions that can be expressed in code. How you ask? Mystical toad magic! Haha just kidding, instead I will be using a thing the humans call "a brain".

Follow me to come along for a breathtaking journey. My intent is to create a computational breakthrough for mankind... I will probably be working on this for awhile until I get it right, though that "brain" thing might help if I ever have time to put it to good use.

Okay, on a more serious note though, I and fully employed within the DoD so I don't have much time between work, college, a wife and two kids! I'll give time up to my project when possible and necessary, and I don't intend on making the project public until it is functional. By then I'll hopefully have a whitepaper written up for this cursed idea that keeps rattling my mind.

I don't intend to give out any spoilers for this mystical project in order to protect my copywrite decision. I may have an idea but I'm not going to be able to protect it from getting stolen by some power-hungry corporation until I've gotten it (mostly) fleshed out. Therefore I will push updates on my bloodandeath.github.io dev blog when I deem so, and I'll reveal maybe certain parts on the project to gain support.

In the long run of things, I have a high ambition but I also am going to be real that I may never finish this. That's okay, I'll give it my best and if I finally give up I'll go public and pass it onto the community to finish. My biggest issue is my lack of code expertise. I've been a hobbyist coder for roughly 14 years (I started very young), but never pursued a career doing so. I am open to any tips and recommendations, feel free to reach out!
